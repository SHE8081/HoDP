;Exercise 155. Design the function colors. It consumes a Russian doll and produces a string of all colors, separate by a comma and a space. Thus our example should produce

(define-struct layer [color doll])

(define an-rd
  (make-layer "yellow" (make-layer "green" "red")))

;RD -> String
;produce all color of RD  
(define (colors an-rd)
  (cond
    [(string? an-rd) an-rd]
    [(layer? an-rd) (string-append (layer-color an-rd) "," (colors (layer-doll an-rd)))]))

;Exercise 156. Design the function inner, which consumes an RD and produces the (color of the) innermost doll. Use DrRacketâ€™s stepper to evaluate (inner rd) for you favorite rd. image

;RN->String
;produce the innermost color of a rd
(define (inner an-rd)
  (cond
    [(string? an-rd) an-rd]
    [(layer? an-rd) (inner (layer-doll an-rd))]))
